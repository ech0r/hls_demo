### HLS Demo written in Rust

Currently the server-side code is vanilla Rust

In the `master` branch I am using video.js for the client

In the `rust-client` branch I am using the `web-sys` and `wasm-bindgen` crates to develop a basic HLS client in Rust.

The project is [hosted here](https://johncooper.xyz)
